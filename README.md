### Programs

#### Program 1: [comparing.js](https://github.com/Sam-B-Y/Color-Comparer/blob/main/comparing.js)
_JavaScript_: Comparing 2 colors by converting their RGB values to L*a*b values and applying Delta-E formulas, **author**. In this example, the 2 colors being compared are (255, 0, 0) and (184, 0, 0).

#### Program 2: [closest.js](https://github.com/Sam-B-Y/Color-Comparer/blob/main/closest.js)
_JavaScript_: Finding the closest pixel in a picture to a given color, **author**. In this example, the program will return the position of the pixel in the image “gradient.jpg” that was the closest to the color (79, 129, 145).

#### Program 3: [color.go](https://github.com/Sam-B-Y/Color-Comparer/blob/main/color.go)
_Go_: **Smith, James**. “Ways to Work out the Average Colour of an Image.” Golang Project Structure, 8 May 2022, https://golangprojectstructure.com/calculating-average-colour-from-images/. 
In this case, the program will return the average color of the image “12.png” in RGB format.
